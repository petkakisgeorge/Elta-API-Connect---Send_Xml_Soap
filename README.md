# Send_Xml_Soap

A java app that implements a SOAP request to ELTAs WebService.
That request contains a build xml file with all transaction info you want to send.
For example you can see the input.txt file.
As a response it's getting a VOUCHER number and printing it inside OneVoucher.txt file.
It can be excecuted from any OS you want. The jar file is inside "out" file. 
For any info, feel free to contact me :)
